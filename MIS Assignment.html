<p><strong><u>Introduction on MIS-The key to efficient Decision
Making.</u></strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, technology plays a vital role in shaping and structuring a
business or an organization. It can be referred as the backbone of all
functions that organizations carry out.</p>
<p>A <strong>Management Information System (MIS)</strong> is an
organized system that collects, processes, stores, and provides
information to support decision-making, coordination, and control in an
organization. It integrates people, technology, and processes to convert
raw data into meaningful information that managers can use for planning,
monitoring, and managing operations effectively. MIS ensures that
accurate and timely information is available to the right person at the
right time. It helps organizations improve efficiency, productivity, and
strategic decision-making. Systems for sales reporting, inventory
control, financial management, and human resource planning are some
examples of MIS.</p>
