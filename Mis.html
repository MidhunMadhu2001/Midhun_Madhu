    <h2 class="section-title">What is Cloud Computing?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is a technology that allows you to store and access
      data and applications over the internet instead of using your computer’s hard drive
      or a local server.
    </p>
    <p>
      It simply means accessing remote servers and powerful mainframe computers housed in
      large data centres, through the internet. The cloud computing model provides greater
      flexibility and scalability compared to traditional on-premises infrastructure.
    </p>

      />
    </div>

    <h2 class="section-title">Architecture of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud computing architecture</strong> refers to the components and
      sub-components required for cloud computing. These components include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Front end</li>
      <li>Back-end</li>
      <li>Cloud-based delivery</li>

    </div>
    -->

    <h2 class="section-title">Benefits of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>
      Compared to traditional on-premises IT, where a company owns and maintains physical
      data centres and servers to access computing power, data storage and other resources,
      cloud computing offers many benefits such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
      <li>Increased speed and agility</li>
      <li>Unlimited scalability</li>
      <li>Enhanced strategic value</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cost-effectiveness</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud computing lets people offload the expense and effort of purchasing, installing,
      configuring and managing mainframe computers and other on-premises infrastructure.
    </p>

    <h3>Increased speed and agility</h3>
    <p>
      With cloud technologies, organizations can use enterprise applications in minutes
      instead of waiting weeks or months for IT to respond to a request, purchase and
      configure supporting hardware, and install software.
    </p>

    <h3>Unlimited scalability</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud computing provides elasticity and self-service provisioning. The cloud
      provider’s global network can be used to spread applications closer to users worldwide.
    </p>

    <h3>Enhanced strategic value</h3>
    <p>
      Cloud computing enables organizations to use various technologies and the most
      up-to-date innovations to gain a competitive edge.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Types of Cloud Computing</h2>

    <!-- Types / deployment models diagram -->

      <img
        src="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Special:FilePath/Cloud_computing_types.svg"
        alt="Diagram of different types of cloud computing"
      />
    </div>

    <h3>Public Cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>public cloud</strong> is a type of cloud computing in which a cloud service
      provider makes computing resources available to users over the public internet.
      These include SaaS applications, individual virtual machines (VMs), bare metal
      computing hardware, complete enterprise-grade infrastructures and development
      platforms. These resources might be accessible for free or according to
      subscription-based or pay-per-usage pricing models.
    </p>
    <p>
      It provides high-bandwidth network connectivity to help ensure high performance and
      rapid access to applications and data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a <strong>multi-tenant</strong> environment where all customers pool and
      share the cloud provider’s data centre infrastructure and other resources. In the
      world of the leading public cloud vendors are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google
      Cloud, IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud.
    </p>

    <h3>Private Cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>private cloud</strong> is a cloud environment where all cloud
      infrastructure and computing resources are dedicated to one customer only. It is
      typically hosted on-premises in the customer’s data centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many companies choose a private cloud over a public cloud environment to meet
      regulatory compliance requirements. Large-scale entities such as government agencies,
      healthcare organizations and financial institutions often opt for private cloud
      settings for workloads that deal with confidential documents, personally identifiable
      information (PII), intellectual property, medical records, financial data or other
      sensitive data.
    </p>

    <h3>Hybrid Cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>hybrid cloud</strong> is a combination of public cloud, private cloud and
      on-premises environments. It connects a combination of these three environments into
      a single, flexible infrastructure for running the organization’s applications and
      workloads.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most enterprise organizations today rely on a hybrid cloud model because it offers
      greater flexibility, scalability and cost optimization than traditional on-premises
      infrastructure setups. According to the IBM Transformation Index: State of Cloud,
      more than 77% of businesses and IT professionals have adopted a hybrid cloud
      approach.
    </p>

    <h3>Multi Cloud</h3>
    <p>
      A <strong>multi cloud</strong> uses two or more clouds from two or more different
      cloud providers. A multi cloud environment can be as simple as email SaaS from one
      vendor and image editing SaaS from another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organizations choose multi cloud to avoid vendor lock-in, have more services to
      select from and access more innovation. With multi cloud, organizations can choose
      and customize a unique set of cloud features and services to meet their business
      needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A multi cloud environment also reduces exposure to licensing, security and
      compatibility issues resulting from “Shadow IT” — any software, hardware or IT
      resource used on an enterprise network without the IT department’s approval and often
      without the knowledge of IT or oversight.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Cloud Security Management Tools</h2>
    <p>
      Cloud security is constantly changing to keep pace with new threats. Today’s CSPs
      offer a wide array of cloud security management tools. They include:
    </p>

    <h3>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>IAM</strong> tools and services automate policy-driven enforcement
      protocols for all users attempting to access both on-premises and cloud-based
      services.
    </p>

    <h3>Data Loss and Prevention (DLP)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>DLP</strong> services combine remediation alerts, data encryption and
      other preventive measures to protect all stored data, whether at rest or in motion.
    </p>

    <h3>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>SIEM</strong> is a comprehensive security orchestration solution that
      automates threat monitoring, detection and response in cloud-based environments.
      It uses AI-driven technologies to correlate log data from various sources across
      multiple platforms and digital assets. This allows IT teams to successfully apply
      their network security protocols, enabling them to react to potential threats
      quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>Automated Data and Compliance Platforms</h3>
    <p>
      Automated software solutions provide compliance controls and centralized data
      collection to help organizations adhere to regulations specific to their industry.
      Regular compliance updates can be built into these platforms so organizations can
      adapt to ever-changing regulatory compliance standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to an International Data Corporation (IDC) forecast, worldwide spending on
      public cloud services is expected to double by 2028.
    </p>

    <p>
      According to the website of IBM, here are some of the main ways businesses can
      benefit from cloud computing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Migrate existing applications to the cloud</li>
      <li>Scale infrastructure</li>
      <li>Enable business continuity and disaster recovery</li>
      <li>Build and test cloud-native applications</li>
      <li>Support edge and IoT environments</li>
      <li>Use cutting-edge technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="section-title">Key Cloud-related Terms</h2>

    <h3>What Is Cloud Hacking?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud hacking</strong> is when a cyber attacker targets cloud-based service
      platforms, such as computing services, storage services or hosted applications.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is Cloud Migration?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud migration</strong> is the process of moving applications and data from
      one location, often a company’s private, on-premises servers, to a public cloud
      provider’s servers. It can also entail moving resources between different clouds.
      Cloud migration benefits include reducing IT costs and improving performance,
      security and convenience.
    </p>

    <h3>What Is Edge Computing?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Edge computing</strong> processes data where it’s created at the “edge” of
      the network rather than sending all the unstructured information to distant data
      centres. The network edge is made of locations that are outside an organization’s
      central infrastructure: retail stores, factory floors, vehicles, remote offices and
      the like.
    </p>
    <p>
      Devices, edge computers and local servers handle processing on-site, transmitting
      only essential data back to central systems and dramatically reducing latency and
      bandwidth demands.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion – The Relevance of Cloud Computing</h2>
    <p>
      Thus, in today’s ever-evolving business world, unlocking the true power of cloud
      technology is not merely an option but an essential strategy. The cloud isn’t just a
      tool; it is a dynamic force for change. Success is shaped within the
      <strong>Cloud Continuum</strong>, a spectrum of capabilities and services spanning
      from public cloud to edge and everything in between, seamlessly connected by
      cloud-first networks and supported by advanced practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the heart of this transformation lie <strong>data and AI</strong>. Migrating
      data is just the first step. Cloud supports the larger opportunity of creating a
      trusted data platform across disparate parts of the business. A modern data platform
      is a prerequisite to advancing AI and ML opportunities. So, embracing cloud as a
      transformative force to propel innovation and competitiveness is essential for
      businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Cloud is the enabler; data is the driver and AI is the differentiator.</strong>
